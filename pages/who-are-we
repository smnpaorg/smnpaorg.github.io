<p style="text-align:center;">We are Farmers, Factory Workers,
Teachers, Ginseng Diggers,
Environmentalists, Loggers,
Landowners, Retirees
and Small Business Owners.
Growers range from
old-time conventional farmers,
tobacco growers, organic farmers,
nurserymen, herbal business owners,
horticultural researchers and
wildcrafters, to new growers.
Together, our diversities help build
a sustainable future
for generations to come.
