<h2>Value of Diversity</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">In nature, environmental stability occurs in areas
having the greatest diversity in plants and  animals.
The Great Smoky Mountains
is one of the most diverse regions on Earth.
As in nature, the strength of
Smoky Mountain
Native Plants Association
is built upon our differences.
It takes each person's skills,
knowledge, talents, and gifts
combined with all of our collective,
cultural, economic, education,
and business experience
to be successful.
Our interdependence
is the foundation of our prosperity.
